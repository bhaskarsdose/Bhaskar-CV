\section*{Objective:} % Details about my objective
\normalfont I am a tech enthusiast and a problem solver guy, I always believe that perseverance beat talent, therefore, I always try, I wanted to build or create new technologies which can help the masses or my country. As I am always interested in the defence sector my aim is to make India reliant on its own defence equipment production and always wanted to mimic the life of Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam sir.

\textbf{\large 1. Real-Time pollution monitor for air quality measurements\\[1pt] }
\\In this project I utilized the raspberry pi 3b+ as a local server to host a webpage as well as to connect various nodes through mosquitto channel on the other hand I have used nodemcu to interface with sensors like bme680,sharp dust sensor and mq135 to measure the data like temprature,pressure,humidity,AQI,NO2,SO2,CO2, PM10\&2.5 and send it to the server to log the data as well as for live display.

\noindent\textbf{\large 2. Smart energy logger and meter\\[1pt]}
\\I am working in building a device which measures multiple parameters like current,voltage,frequency and temperature for various purposes like energy monitoring, battery health and to make some real-time observation of what is electricity consumption for the purpose of increasing efficiency and health of the whole systems like in factories there is lot of energy wasted due to nonavailability of smart measuring devices which collects the data by the help of which we can improve a lot of things.

\noindent\textbf{\large 3. Real-time heart rate and temperature monitor using IoT\\[1pt]}
\\This project is been selected at vihaan 2.0 hackathon of dtu Delhi In this project we used thingspeak API and created an app through MIT app inventor, On which we get the live data of heart rate and temperature sensor,After this the data go into the Thingspeak API where we used simple algorithms to build the graphs/plots and our next motive is to compare this data by prebuilt dataset which can help the patient in real life.

\noindent\textbf{\large 4. Geyser feedback circuit\\[1pt]}
\\In this project, we used thyristor(negative coefficient one) to sense the temperature by the help of which the feedback circuit gets its input which in turn with the help of npn transistors turn ON and OFF the relay connected with it which finally cut off and on the main supply to the heating aliment,this project is simply a basic prototype for understanding the working of various electronic components and their switching.\\[2pt]

\noindent\textbf{\large 5. Smart Socket\\[1pt]}
\\This my internship project or mine first IoT based project from which I learnt PCB designing, relay control circuit, nodemcu interfacing and connecting it to the internet or locally using bluetooth hc-05 to give its command for turning on and off the appliances connected with the socket , Along with that I also integrated this with the \textbf{IFTTT} template to turn on and off the relay using the google voice assistent as it generates the instance which goes to the cloud which send the command to the applet.

\noindent\textbf{\large 6. Smart water monitoring and management system\\[1pt]}
\\This project basically work as an automatic control system for the water pumps in this we used two nodemcu which communicate with each other to turn ON and OFF the motor , one nodemcu is connected at the water tank with ultrasonic sensor which measures the water level and other with the relay to disconnect or connect the supply with the motor.\\[2pt] 

\noindent\textbf{\large 7. Mini quadcopter\\[1pt]}
\\I am currently working on this project using eachine flight controller using this we can do a certain task easily which we can define later.
