\noindent\textbf{\large 1. RTK Injection System Over NTRIP Server\\[1pt]}
\\\textbf{RTK or real-time kinematics} is used to enhance the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems (global navigation satellite systems, GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, NavIC and BeiDou. In \textbf{drone swarming} applications this plays a very vital role for centimetre level accuracy, Built using a ublox-m8p-2 module from here+, corrections are transmitted through NTRIP caster using RTCM data packages.
